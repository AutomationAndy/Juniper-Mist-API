# Examples by Use-Case #

## Description ##

Here is where functional examples will live. These will be based on a use-case or workflow instead of just just an explanation and example of an API call. They will not have a lot of error handling in them, and may not be best practice per any accepted standard but they work have solved a real world use-case.

## Warnings and Cautions ##

This should go without saying, but don't use any of this stuff in production! This is for educational and learning use only. Remember to always try to limit your blast radius! Try reading something with python first, then try reading a lot of things, then edit one thing, then maybe a hand full of things before you set a robot out into production to search and destroy.

There is actually a lot you can do without any hardware in a Mist Dashboard at all, copy/paste/modify what's in here to learn how API interacts vs CLI.
