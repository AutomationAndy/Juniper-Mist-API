# API Token #
## Overall Description ##

This is step 1. You need this to do just about anything else in this repo. This is where you generate/manage/delete API tokens. Tokens can also be setup on the Mist dashboard under Organization > Settings then the "API Token" box. You can setup tokens that only have access to specific things, like sites, site groups, or user roles like observer (read-only) or super user (read/write). I suggest you create a token per project/integration with only the access required for your project. This way if something breaks or someone gets your token you can just delete the token and it wont affect any other automation projects you have.
