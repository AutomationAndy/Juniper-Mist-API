# MSP APIs #

## Description ##

MSP = Managed Service Provider - I've also heard of it as Multi-Service Provider  

This is more for companies that provide a managed service to more than one customer at a time. They have the ability to move subscriptions around different organizations and see dashboards that normal users won't ever see.
