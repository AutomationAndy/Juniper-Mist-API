# Postman Workspace #

## Description ##

<https://www.postman.com/>

This is the export of the Postman workspace that I created to mirror the formatting of this repo with Postman examples. Unfotunately I can't figure out an easy way to include just the request inside the appropriate folder inside GitHub so this is an export of the entire workspace formatted the same as this repo.  

Instructions  
You can import this json file from the home page of Postman. Select "Importan existing file" from the "Getting started with Postman" section.
