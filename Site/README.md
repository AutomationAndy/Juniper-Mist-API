# Site APIs #

## Description ##

Just like the Organizational level APIs, this is where you'll spend most of your time. This is where you can get at all the cool WiFi APIs, like device and client info. Remember to use the right token for the right job, though. If you're making a robot that only needs to affect changes in one particular site, setup a read-write site level token for it. This way if something goes wrong you can just delete the token and the mad robot will stop its rampage, and its rampage will only reach the things you let it reach, rather than everything all at once.
